# Excursion Project
In this project, I create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” I use  HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.

The web page I am  building  advertises a fictional mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so I’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

This is a project from a *codecademy* course, Git and GitHub.
